# Mission Plan - Helix-like Neovim Configuration

## Mission Statement
Create a Neovim configuration that provides Helix editor's keybindings and workflow while maintaining Neovim's plugin ecosystem and extensibility.

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic Helix-style keymaps implemented
- ✅ Plugin system configured with lazy.nvim
- ✅ Core plugins integrated (telescope, treesitter, lsp)
- ⚠️ Helix register system partially implemented
- ⚠️ Motion system needs refinement

## Phase 1: Core Helix Experience (Current)
- [ ] Complete Helix register system (yank/paste/replace)
- [ ] Implement Helix selection modes (extend vs select)
- [ ] Add Helix-style object selection (textobjects)
- [ ] Configure Helix-like status line
- [ ] Add Helix command palette (Space mode)

## Phase 2: Advanced Features
- [ ] Helix multiple cursor support
- [ ] Helix search and replace workflow
- [ ] Helix file picker with preview
- [ ] Helix buffer management (vsplit/hsplit)
- [ ] Helix command mode (:

## Phase 3: Polish & Optimization
- [ ] Performance optimization for large files
- [ ] Custom Helix themes
- [ ] Documentation and keybinding cheatsheet
- [ ] User configuration overrides
- [ ] Migration guide from vanilla Neovim

## Key Principles
1. **Fidelity**: Maintain Helix's modal editing philosophy
2. **Extensibility**: Leverage Neovim's plugin ecosystem
3. **Performance**: Keep startup time under 100ms
4. **Discoverability**: Clear keybinding documentation
5. **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when plugins unavailable

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All Helix core keybindings functional
- [ ] Sub-100ms startup time
- [ ] Zero conflicts with Neovim defaults
- [ ] Complete keybinding documentation
- [ ] User can switch between Helix/Neovim modes
