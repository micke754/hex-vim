this works well and has been the best solution for this thus far so thanks for that. On a different note, i noticed that the motions are slightly different to how they are in helix. For example using the phrase "This is a test" and if my cursor is at the start of a word say "This" and the next word is "is" if I pressed the `e` motion twice in helix, the cursor would move to the end of "This" resting on the "s" with the whole word highlighted. On the second press of the `e` motion; the cursor would sit at the end of the word "is" but have the whitespace between the previous word "This" and "is" highlighted. So summarise, on the second `e` motion "(1-whitespace)is" is all highlighted. Now in neovim it is similar except on the second `e` motion "s(1-whitespace)is" is highlighted, so s from the word "This" is also being highlighted in addition. how do you think we can resolve this difference in behaviour?
